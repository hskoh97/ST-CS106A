## Programming Methodology #1
### The Debugging Story
#### The Oldest Story
Originated from mechanical engineering: fixing mechanical stuffs were called debugging in 1800s.

#### An Apocryphal Story
Grace Murray Hopper, one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, literally found a moth being electrocuted in the computer. The electrical components got short by the moth and did not work properly.

Once she removed the moth, the computer started working again.

### The Origin of the Name "Robot"
The name was first invented by Karel ÄŒapek in his science fiction Rossum's Universal Robots.

### Karel the Robot
Karel is a Java-based game used to demonstrate programming concepts without having to learn too much programming language.

Learning the syntaxes behind programming languages can take a long time, and you could be lost in the syntax of the programs instead of the actual concepts.

Karel aims to demonstrate the syntax in a less complicated way and let first-time learner adopt software engineering concepts quickly.
